# Package Upgrade Plan - My Blog Frontend

## Overview
This document tracks the comprehensive package upgrade plan for the blog frontend project. Each upgrade follows a standardized 8-step process to ensure safety and functionality preservation.

## Workflow Pattern (Applied to Each Package)
1. **Backup**: Create dedicated backup branch 
2. **Research**: Analyze breaking changes from official docs
3. **Scan**: Find all usage patterns in codebase
4. **Upgrade**: Install new package version
5. **Refactor**: Fix breaking changes and update code
6. **Auto Test**: Run test suite, lint, and build (with proper container management)
7. **Manual Test**: Show affected pages for verification
8. **Confirmation**: Wait for approval before next upgrade

### Container Management for Builds
**Important**: Before running any build command:
1. Stop development server: `docker-compose down`
2. Start fresh container: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Run build: `docker-compose exec app yarn run build`
4. This prevents conflicts between dev server and build process

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 0: Baseline Setup
- [x] Create backup branch (backup-pre-upgrade)
- [x] Document current package versions (yarn list)
- [x] Run comprehensive baseline tests (test, lint, build) - **BUILD FAILED**
- [ ] Create functional testing checklist document

### Phase 0.5: CRITICAL - Vite Migration (Build System Overhaul)

- üîç Search and filtering
- üß≠ Navigation and routing
- üì± Mobile responsiveness
- üé® Visual elements (icons, diagrams)
- üîê Authentication flow
- üìä Performance and loading

## Rollback Procedures

**If any upgrade fails:**
1. `docker-compose down`
2. `git checkout [backup-branch-name]`
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. `docker-compose exec app yarn install`
5. Test functionality restoration
6. Reassess upgrade approach

## Notes and Updates

### Known Issues:
- **CRITICAL: Build System Failure**: React 19.1.1 incompatible with react-scripts 5.0.1
  - Error: `'__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED' is not exported from 'react'`
  - Solution: Complete migration to Vite build system
- **Container Management**: Development server conflicts with build process - always run `docker-compose down` before builds
- **Test Failures**: Some tests fail due to react-router-dom import issues in test environment
- **Lint Warnings**: 11 ESLint warnings in current codebase (acceptable for baseline)

### Vite Migration Complexity:
- **11 files require modification**: package.json, index.html, main.jsx, vite.config.js, 3 env files, 4 source files
- **Environment variables**: All REACT_APP_ ‚Üí VITE_ prefixes need dual compatibility
- **File structure**: HTML moves from public/ to root, index.js ‚Üí main.jsx
- **Import syntax**: process.env ‚Üí import.meta.env throughout codebase
- **Docker compatibility**: Development and build processes need verification
