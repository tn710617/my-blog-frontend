# Package Upgrade Plan - My Blog Frontend

## Overview
This document tracks the comprehensive package upgrade plan for the blog frontend project. Each upgrade follows a standardized 8-step process to ensure safety and functionality preservation.

## Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Hierarchy
```
main (production)
└── upgrade (main upgrade branch)
    ├── upgrade-phase-1-gh-pages
    ├── upgrade-phase-2-react-query  
    ├── upgrade-phase-3-testing-libraries
    ├── upgrade-phase-4-utilities
    ├── upgrade-phase-5-mermaid
    ├── upgrade-phase-6-react-icons
    ├── upgrade-phase-7-headless-ui
    ├── upgrade-phase-8-react-router
    └── upgrade-phase-9-react-markdown
```

### Branch Descriptions
- **`main`** - Production branch (stable)
- **`upgrade`** - Main upgrade branch (integrates all upgrade phases)
- **`upgrade-phase-N-package-name`** - Individual upgrade phase branches
- **`vite-migration`** - Completed Vite migration (can be merged to `upgrade` as starting point)

### Setup Process
1. Create main upgrade branch: `git checkout -b upgrade vite-migration`
2. For each phase: `git checkout -b upgrade-phase-N-package-name upgrade`
3. After phase completion: Merge back to `upgrade`
4. Final step: Merge `upgrade` to `main`

### Workflow Pattern (Applied to Each Package)
1. **Branch**: Create phase-specific branch from `upgrade` branch
2. **Research**: Analyze breaking changes from official docs  
3. **Scan**: Find all usage patterns in codebase
4. **Upgrade**: Install new package version
5. **Refactor**: Fix breaking changes and update code
6. **Auto Test**: Run test suite, lint, and build (with proper container management)
7. **Manual Test**: Show affected pages for verification
8. **Merge**: After approval, merge phase branch to `upgrade` branch
9. **Cleanup**: Delete phase branch after successful merge

### Container Management for Builds
**Important**: Before running any build command:
1. Stop development server: `docker-compose down`
2. Start fresh container: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Run build: `docker-compose exec app yarn run build`
4. This prevents conflicts between dev server and build process

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 0: Baseline Setup
